The device will detect flooding in the yard of the home by monitoring the level, and the turbidity,
of run-oâ†µ water in the sump. When the water level in the sump rises above a pre-set level, a pump
will be used to empty the sump. The keypad will be used to set the conditions for pump operation,
and send information to a central home system.
